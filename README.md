# IGDB-portal

Dog life cycle management tool for the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind. 

# Installation

Set up supabase account and populate it via the sql scripts:
- `sql/create-tables.sql`
- `sql/seed-data.sql` 

You will need to create user accounts and update their UUIDs across the sample data in order to use the sample data.
As the UUID generated by Supabase is not modifiable. You will need 3 accounts.

You will also need to have Node.js installed (LTS is fine) then run the following commands:

```bash
npm i # Install dependencies
npm run dev # Start the development server
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:5173`.

You will need to modify .env to point at your own supabase instance should that be required.

There is a deployed demo of the application at https://igdb-portal.paradaux.io which uses my [RÃ­an] development supabase instance.
